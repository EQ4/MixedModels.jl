# Linear mixed-effects models in [Julia](http://julialang.org)

## Fitting linear mixed-effects models

The `lmm` function is similar to the `lmer` function in the
[lme4](http://cran.R-project.org/package=lme4) package for
[R](http://www.R-project.org).  The first two arguments for in the `R`
version are `formula` and `data`.  The principle method for the
`Julia` version takes these arguments.

### A model fit to the `Dyestuff` data from the `lme4` package

The simplest example of a mixed-effects model that we use in the
[lme4 package for R](https://github.com/lme4/lme4) is a model fit to
the `Dyestuff` data.

```R
> str(Dyestuff)
'data.frame':	30 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ Batch: Factor w/ 6 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ Yield: num  1545 1440 1440 1520 1580 ...
> (fm1 <- lmer(Yield ~ 1|Batch, Dyestuff, REML=FALSE))
Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood ['lmerMod']
Formula: Yield ~ 1 | Batch 
   Data: Dyestuff 

      AIC       BIC    logLik  deviance 
 333.3271  337.5307 -163.6635  327.3271 

Random effects:
 Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.
 Batch    (Intercept) 1388     37.26   
 Residual             2451     49.51   
Number of obs: 30, groups: Batch, 6

Fixed effects:
            Estimate Std. Error t value
(Intercept)  1527.50      17.69   86.33
```

These `Dyestuff` data are available in the `RDatasets` package for `julia`
```julia
julia> using MixedModels, RDatasets

julia> ds = dataset("lme4","Dyestuff");

julia> head(ds)
6x2 DataFrame
|-------|-------|-------|
| Row # | Batch | Yield |
| 1     | A     | 1545  |
| 2     | A     | 1440  |
| 3     | A     | 1440  |
| 4     | A     | 1520  |
| 5     | A     | 1580  |
| 6     | B     | 1540  |
```

`lmm` defaults to maximum likelihood estimation whereas `lmer` in `R`
defaults to REML estimation.

```julia
julia> m = lmm(Yield ~ 1|Batch, ds)
Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood
 logLik: -163.663530, deviance: 327.327060

 Variance components:
                Variance    Std.Dev.
 Batch        1388.342960   37.260474
 Residual     2451.247052   49.510070
 Number of obs: 30; levels of grouping factors: 6

  Fixed-effects parameters:
     Estimate Std.Error z value
[1]    1527.5   17.6946 86.3258
```

(The formatting of the output will be improved.)

In general the model should be fit through an explicit call to the `fit`
function, which may take a second argument indicating a verbose fit.

```julia
julia> @time fit(lmm(Yield ~ 1|Batch, ds),true);
f_1: 327.76702, [1.0]
f_2: 331.03619, [1.75]

f_7: 327.35315, [0.807188]
f_8: 327.34663, [0.799688]

f_15: 327.32706, [0.752584]
FTOL_REACHED
elapsed time: 0.002629257 seconds (127568 bytes allocated)
```

The numeric representation of the model has type
```julia
julia> typeof(m)
LMMScalar1 (constructor with 2 methods)
```

It happens that `show`ing an object of this type causes the model to
be fit so it is okay to omit the call to `fit` in the REPL (the
interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop).

Those familiar with the `lme4` package for `R` will see the usual
suspects.
```julia
julia> fixef(m)  # estimates of the fixed-effects parameters
1-element Array{Float64,1}:
 1527.5

julia> show(coef(m))  # another name for fixef
[1527.4999999999998]

julia> ranef(m)
1x6 Array{Float64,2}:
 -16.6283  0.369517  26.9747  -21.8015  53.5799  -42.4944

julia> ranef(m,true) # on the U scale
1x6 Array{Float64,2}:
 -22.0949  0.490998  35.8428  -28.9689  71.1947  -56.4647

julia> deviance(m)
327.3270598812219
```

## A more substantial example

Fitting a model to the `Dyestuff` data is trivial.  The `InstEval`
data in the `lme4` package is more of a challenge in that there are
nearly 75,000 evaluations by 2972 students on a total of 1128
instructors.

```julia
julia> inst = dataset("lme4","InstEval");

julia> head(inst)
6x7 DataFrame

| Row # | S | D    | Studage | Lectage | Service | Dept | Y |
