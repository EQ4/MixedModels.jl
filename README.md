## Fitting linear mixed-effects models

The `lmm` function is similar to the `lmer` function in the
[lme4](http://cran.R-project.org/package=lme4) package for
[R](http://www.R-project.org).  The first two arguments for in the `R`
version are `formula` and `data`.  The principle method for the
`Julia` version takes these arguments.

### A model fit to the `Dyestuff` data from the `lme4` package

The simplest example of a mixed-effects model that we use in the
[lme4 package for R](https://github.com/lme4/lme4) is a model fit to
the `Dyestuff` data.

```R
> str(Dyestuff)
'data.frame':	30 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ Batch: Factor w/ 6 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ Yield: num  1545 1440 1440 1520 1580 ...
> (fm1 <- lmer(Yield ~ 1|Batch, Dyestuff, REML=FALSE))
Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood ['lmerMod']
Formula: Yield ~ 1 | Batch 
   Data: Dyestuff 

      AIC       BIC    logLik  deviance 
 333.3271  337.5307 -163.6635  327.3271 

Random effects:
 Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.
 Batch    (Intercept) 1388     37.26
 Residual             2451     49.51
 Number of obs: 30, groups: Batch, 6

Fixed effects:
            Estimate Std. Error t value
(Intercept)  1527.50      17.69   86.33
```

These `Dyestuff` data are available in the `RDatasets` package for `julia`
```julia
julia> using MixedModels, RDatasets

julia> ds = dataset("lme4","Dyestuff");

julia> head(ds)
6x2 DataFrame
|-------|-------|-------|
| Row # | Batch | Yield |
| 1     | A     | 1545  |
| 2     | A     | 1440  |
| 3     | A     | 1440  |
| 4     | A     | 1520  |
| 5     | A     | 1580  |
| 6     | B     | 1540  |
```

`lmm` defaults to maximum likelihood estimation whereas `lmer` in `R`
defaults to REML estimation.

```julia
julia> m = lmm(Yield ~ 1|Batch, ds)
Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood
Formula: Yield ~ 1 | Batch

 logLik: -163.663530, deviance: 327.327060

 Variance components:
                Variance    Std.Dev.
 Batch        1388.331690   37.260323
 Residual     2451.250503   49.510105
 Number of obs: 30; levels of grouping factors: 6

  Fixed-effects parameters:
             Estimate Std.Error z value
(Intercept)    1527.5   17.6945  86.326
```

(The formatting of the output will be improved.)

In general the model should be fit through an explicit call to the `fit`
function, which may take a second argument indicating a verbose fit.

```julia
julia> @time fit(lmm(Yield ~ 1|Batch, ds),true);
f_1: 327.76702, [1.0]
f_2: 328.63496, [0.428326]
f_3: 327.33773, [0.787132]
f_4: 328.27031, [0.472809]
f_5: 327.33282, [0.727955]
f_6: 327.32706, [0.752783]

f_8: 327.32706, [0.752355]

f_10: 327.32706, [0.75258]
FTOL_REACHED
elapsed time: 0.002485569 seconds (172340 bytes allocated)
```

The numeric representation of the model has type
```julia
julia> typeof(m)
LinearMixedModel{PLSOne} (constructor with 2 methods)
```
A `LinearMixedModel` is parameterized by the type of the solver
for the penalized least-squares (PLS) problem.  The simplicity of the
PLS problem when there is a single grouping factor is exploited in the
`PLSOne` class which provides for evaluation of the objective function
and of its gradient.

Those familiar with the `lme4` package for `R` will see the usual
suspects.
```julia
julia> fixef(m)  # estimates of the fixed-effects parameters
1-element Array{Float64,1}:
 1527.5

julia> show(coef(m))  # another name for fixef
[1527.5]

julia> ranef(m)
1-element Array{Any,1}:
 1x6 Array{Float64,2}:
 -16.6282  0.369516  26.9747  -21.8014  53.5798  -42.4943

julia> ranef(m,true)  # on the u scale
1-element Array{Any,1}:
 1x6 Array{Float64,2}:
 -22.0949  0.490999  35.8429  -28.9689  71.1948  -56.4649

julia> deviance(m)
327.3270598811376
```

## A more substantial example

Fitting a model to the `Dyestuff` data is trivial.  The `InstEval`
data in the `lme4` package is more of a challenge in that there are
nearly 75,000 evaluations by 2972 students on a total of 1128
instructors.

```julia
julia> inst = dataset("lme4","InstEval");

julia> head(inst)

For models with a single random-effects term a gradient-based
optimization is used, allowing faster and more reliable convergence to
the parameter estimates.
